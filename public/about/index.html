CONNOR, I want to say good job. You've got the structure down. Here are some css if you want to use them, but just make sure to add "display: flex" when using them: 
text-align: center;
this can be used to center align text. Flex-start (to align to start) and flex-end (to align to end) also work
align-items: center;
Used to align items in the center of a flex container vertically. (flex-start and flex-end also work)
justify-content: center;
Used to align items horisontally (flex-start and flex-end also work)
flex-direction: column;
Switches the jobs of align-items: center; and justify-content: center; (ish). For a better explanation, look at MDN Web Docs (type it in, hover over it, and click the link)
